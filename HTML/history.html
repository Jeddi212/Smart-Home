		<h2 class="hvr-underline-from-left">The Journey Begins</h2>
		<p>
			The first smart homes were ideas, not actual structures. For decades, science fiction has explored the idea of home 
			automation. Prolific writers, such as Ray Bradbury, imagined a future where homes were interactive, and seemingly 
			ran themselves. In Bradbury’s cautionary short story, “There Will Come Soft Rains” he describes an automated home 
			that continues to function even after humans have died out. It’s all well and frightening, until you consider the 
			actual benefits of home automation, and then the idea becomes more comforting than chilling.
		</p>
		<p>
			Although the idea of home automation has been around for some time, actual smart homes have only existed a short 
			while. This timeline focuses on hardware; meaning actual inventions leading up to the smart homes we know today 
			and can expect from the near future.
		</p>
		
		<h2 class="hvr-underline-from-left">1901 – 1920 - The Invention of Home Appliances</h2>
		<p>
			Although home appliances aren’t what we’d consider “smart,” 
			they were an incredible achievement in the early twentieth century. These achievements began with the first 
			engine-powered vacuum cleaner in 1901. A more practical electricity-powered vacuum was invented in 1907. 
			Throughout two decades refrigerators would be invented, as well as clothes dryers, washing machines, irons, 
			toasters, and so much more.
		</p>
		
		<h2 class="hvr-underline-from-left">1966 – 1967 - ECHO IV and the Kitchen Computer</h2>
		<p>
			Although it was never commercially sold, the ECHO IV was the first 
			smart device. This clever device could compute shopping lists, control the home’s temperature and turn appliances on 
			and off. The Kitchen Computer, developed a year later, could store recipes, but had the unfortunate tagline, 
			“If she can only cook as well as Honeywell can computer” and therefore sold no models.
		</p>
		
		<h2 class="hvr-underline-from-left">1991- Gerontechnology</h2>
		<p>
			Gerontechnology combines gerontology and technology and  makes the lives of senior citizens easier. 
			In the 1990s, there was a lot of new research and technology in this sector.
		</p>
		
		<h2 class="hvr-underline-from-left">1998 – Early 2000s: Smart Homes</h2>
		<p>
			Smart homes, or home automation, began to increase in popularity in the early 2000s. 
			As such, different technology began to emerge. Smart homes suddenly became a more affordable option, and therefore a 
			viable technology for consumers. Domestic technologies, home networking, and other gadgets began to appear on store shelves.
		</p>
		
		
		<h2 class="hvr-underline-from-left">Today’s Smart Homes</h2>
		<p>
			Today’s smart homes are more about security and living greener. Our smart homes are sustainable, and they 
			help to ensure that our homes aren’t expending unnecessary energy. They also help alert us to intruders (whether we’re home or not). 
			Current trends in home automation include remote mobile control, automated lights, automated thermostat adjustment, scheduling 
			appliances, mobile/email/text notifications, and remote video surveillance.

		<h2>From a technical perspective, <br>Home Automation consists of five building blocks:</h2>
		
		<div id = "accordion">
			<h3 class="k1j hvr-ripple-out">I. Devices Under Control</h3>
				<div class="k1">
					<p>
						Devices under control are all components, such as home appliances or consumer electronics, 
						which are connected to and controlled by the home automation system.
					</p>
				</div>
			
			<h3 class="k2j hvr-ripple-out">II. Sensors and Actuators</h3>
				<div class="k2">
					<p>
						Sensors are the eyes and ears of the home network. There are sensors for a wide range of applications such as 
						measuring temperature, humidity, light, liquid, and gas and detecting movement or noise.
					</p>
					<p>
						Actuators are the hands of the home network. They are the meansof how the smart network can actually do things 
						in the real world. Depending on the type of interaction required, there are mechanical actuators such as pumps 
						and electrical motors or electronic actuators such as electric switches and dimmers.
					</p>
				</div>
			
			<h3 class="k3j hvr-ripple-out">III. The Control Network</h3>
				<div class="k3">
					<p>
						The control network provides the connectivity between devices under control, sensors, and actuators on the one 
						hand and the controller along with remote control devices on the other hand.
					</p>
					<p>
						There are three main technology options for home and building automation control networks today:
						<ul>
							<li>Powerline Communication</li>
							<li>Wireless Transmission</li>
							<li>Wireline Transmission</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p>
						In general, control networks based on power line communication and wireless transmission are dominant in residential 
						home automation due to lower component prices and installation cost. Wire line control networks, on the other hand, 
						are found in the premium residential segment and in industrial building control applications.
					</p>
				</div>
			
			<h3 class="k4j hvr-ripple-out">IV. The Controller</h3>
				<div class="k4">
					<p>
						The controller is the computer system which acts as the brain of the building automation system. 
						It collects information through sensors and receives commands through remote control devices. 
						It acts based on commands or a set of predefined rules using actuators or means of communication such as 
						loud speaker, email, or telephone.
					</p>
					<p>
						One of the main reasons for the increased acceptance of home automation systems in the residential segment is that, 
						with the omnipresence of smart phones and tablets, the need for dedicated automation control devices has vanished. 
						Within a few years, literally all home automation systems on the market have introduced smartphone and tablet based control applications. 
						In addition, advances in voice recognition have finally brought voice based control to smart homes as well.
					</p>
				</div>

			<h3 class="k5j hvr-ripple-out">V. Remote Control Device</h3>
				<div class="k5">
					<p>
						The remote control devices act by connecting to the home automation application on the home controller. 
						They do this eitherby connecting to the controller through the control network itself, or through any other 
						interface the controller provides, such as WLAN,the Internet, or the telephone network. 
						Thus, the use of smartphonesas a home remote makes the capability of remote building control via Internet or 
						the mobile telephone network a feature which is available as a default.
